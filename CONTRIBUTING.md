# Contributing to CVLetterAI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CVLetterAI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style (ESLint + Prettier)
* Write meaningful commit messages
* Add comments for complex logic

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CVLetterAI.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check code style
npm run lint
```

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` code restructuring

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/joshsegatt/CVLetterAI/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We welcome feature requests! Please provide:

- **Use case**: Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Proposed solution**: How you envision the feature working
- **Alternatives**: Any alternative solutions you've considered
- **Additional context**: Screenshots, mockups, or examples
